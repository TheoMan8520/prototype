# Weekly web application

**I** always digitally write down what I have to do, what I have done, how I feel about specific occations during a day and others things I could think of and that worth to be written. There're templates I made for myself to write down those records in each day and for every record, I would put a sticker infront of each just to be an identifier telling what kind of recod is this. 

**The problem** is that despite the templates, I still have to manually duplicate and manage the old notes. Sometimes, I just want to quickly recap the day but there's the need to manage and setup so I find myself having no motivation most of the time due to said issue. Then I decided to build Weekly.

**Weekly** is a web application that serves its user as a system of pieces of notes every day. It has calendar and set of categories for user to create and use as desire. Though the work is in process, underlying functions are finished. I use React with Typescript as frontend and Laravel as backend.

The original design concepts:
